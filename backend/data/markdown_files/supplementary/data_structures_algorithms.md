# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Overview
Data structures and algorithms form the foundation of computer science and software engineering.

## Core Data Structures
- Arrays and Dynamic Arrays
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees (Binary, BST, AVL, Red-Black)
- Heaps and Priority Queues
- Hash Tables
- Graphs

## Essential Algorithms
- Sorting: QuickSort, MergeSort, HeapSort
- Searching: Binary Search, DFS, BFS
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Graph Algorithms: Dijkstra's, Kruskal's, Prim's
